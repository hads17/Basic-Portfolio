	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src="assets/images/Profilepicture.jpg">
	<p>I graduated from Provo High School in 2016. While in high school I was in their ballroom dance program and that was really great, I learned how to work in a team and also how to work with partners. I have lived in Utah my entire life and I enjoy the mountains and all the experiences I've had in them. I enjoy the outdoors and enjoy going backpacking and hiking. I have recently found a love for programming and development. Music is another one of my passions. I love playing the piano and just listening to music in my free time.</p>
	
	<p>I am currently going to a web-development bootcamp that's being ran by the University of Utah. I hope after the six months that I'll be learning there that I will be able to go into the field of web-development and do programming for the rest of my life.</p>
